Traffic Accident Data Analysis
This project analyzes traffic accident data to uncover patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. It also visualizes accident hotspots and identifies contributing factors to enhance road safety.

Steps

Data Preprocessing:

Cleaned and prepared the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzed the impact of road conditions, weather, and time of day on accidents.
Visualized accident trends by location, time, and weather conditions.

Hotspot Visualization:

Mapped accident hotspots using geospatial data.
Highlighted areas with frequent accidents under specific conditions.

Insights and Patterns:

Identified key factors contributing to accidents (e.g., poor lighting, wet roads, peak hours).

Key Findings
Weather: Rainy and foggy conditions led to a significant increase in accidents.
Time of Day: Accidents peaked during rush hours (7–9 AM and 5–7 PM).
Road Conditions: Wet and icy roads were strongly associated with severe accidents.
Hotspots: Urban intersections and highways showed the highest accident densities.

Conclusion
The analysis highlights how weather, road conditions, and time of day influence accident occurrences. These insights can guide road safety initiatives, traffic management, and public awareness campaigns to reduce accidents and save lives.
